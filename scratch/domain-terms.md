## IoT

## Password Manager

- 1Password: great pw manager, I'm a huge fan (src: pj)


## VPN

- VPN Vendors:
  - Cloak (src: rmoran)
  - Hotspot Shield
  - TorGuard
  - CyberGhost
  - HideMyAss
- http://www.vpn4all.com/

## Firewall

- pfSense: https://www.pfsense.org/ Open source firewall software. Pretty
  advanced stuff (i.e. you need to be ready to do some network admin things),
  but you can download packages to expand upon it and do neat things (i.e. sniff
  for network traffic and block things that are malicious, region blocking, etc)
  and right out of the box it'll run openVPN and handle things like MAC address
  whitelisting. (src: pj)

- Tomato: http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato Open source router firmware. Less
  advanced than pfSense, but still requires some advanced know-how as you'll
  need to flash the firmware on your wireless router. Once you do that, it has
  some neat options for setting schedules on WiFi (i.e. making your kids go
  outside and play) and some other fun things. (src: pj)

## General Advice

- make sure to lock your screen when walking away from your computer (src: pj)
- set up two factor authentication where possible (perhaps we should dig up
  links for the more popular social networks/email platforms 2FA set up
  processes and merely point them out) (src: pj)
- change the password for your wireless router (src: pj)
- don't share your passwords with others (src: pj)
- use a strong passcode on your mobile devices (src: pj)
